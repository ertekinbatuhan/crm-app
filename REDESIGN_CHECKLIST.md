## Missing Items to Handle

3. Ensure consistency with the design system

### Additional Components Needed
- Toast/Snackbar notifications
- Confirmation dialogs
- Date/Time pickers
- Dropdown selectors
- Search fields
- Filter chips

- Views should have minimal body code - logic in components
- Maintain MVVM architecture - don't change ViewModels/Services
- Focus on presentation layer only
- Ensure mobile responsiveness throughout
